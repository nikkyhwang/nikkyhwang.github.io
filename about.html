    <p class="pOne">I was born and raised in Tacoma/Puyallup Washington and I am 23 years young. I'm a student who will be an EWU graduate in Spring 2019. Majoring 
        in Visual Communication Design, a minor in 3D Animation, and a User Experience Design 
        Certificate. 
   <br/>    I am the youngest of three daughters of two amazing parents. Growing up, my parents never gave us the
        thought of making a career out of "art". They were so determined to make sure we focused on "real" education 
        and getting a job that was well paid. So throughout high school and the beginning of college, I tried 
        different classes to figure out what I wanted to do but nothing sparked my attention. It wasn't until
        the second year when my community college advisor (who was also the head of the graphic design program) encouraged
        me to take one of his 3D animation courses. The next quarter, I started and let me tell you, I felt so intimidated
        because I was basically the only one not in that program but fell in love with it instantly. 
    </p>

<container id="pTwo">
    <p class="pTwo"> Fast forwarding to when I got accepted into EWU for a 3D Animation Major, I was ready to declare my major when I got there, 
        but when I did, EWU told me that they did not offer the program anymore and only had a minor in it. My life was sort of 
        crushed when my advisor told me. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I declared myself as a Computer Science major. I 
        took one quarter of it and said no thank you. So I was just going to finish up the year with the minor and just move back home. I signed up
        for a VCD class because I didn't care anymore and wanted to try it out. It wasn't animation, but I enjoyed it and then, I discovered
        the UX Certificate and found out what it was and it was something I was definitely interested. UX/Web Design is something I can see
        myself practicing and working hard to find a career in. 
    <br/>
    So, if you couldn't tell by my story, my experience with design and art only started a couple years ago. Yeah, I may not
        have to best work, but I am only just starting and passionate and eager to learn more. My main focus and passion in 
        the design field is User Experience and Web Design. Coding is something where I could sit infront of my computer for hours and 
        figure out how to learn something new.
